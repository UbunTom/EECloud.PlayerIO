##EECloud.PlayerIO
[EECloud.PlayerIO (C++)](http://github.com/UbunTom/EECloud.PlayerIO) is an unofficial open-sourced version of the [Player.IO](http://playerio.com/) client DLL written in [C++](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C++). The code here uses the latest C++11 standard, so you will need a up to date compiler to use it.

This is the C++ port

Compiling
---------

Tested with g++ 4.7.2.

Link with curl and protobuf.

Use -std=c++11 flag.

Problems
--------
The uncompiled .proto files are not easily compiled, but this isn't a problem unless you are editing these files. Anyone with better protobuf knowledge, feel free to clean them up.
